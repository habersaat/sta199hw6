## Task 1: Find the first letter of Wordle words

From https://github.com/tabatkins/wordle-list.

```{r}

# read wordle dataset
wordle <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tabatkins/wordle-list/main/words", col_names = "word")

# Add first letter column
wordle <- wordle |> 
  mutate(first_letter = str_sub(word, start = 1, end = 1))

# Count the number of entries with a given first letter
wordle_counts <- wordle |>
  count(first_letter, sort = TRUE)

wordle_counts
```

## Task 2: Draw a keyboard

```{r}
ggkeyboard(tkl, layout = "iso")
```

## Task 3: Color keyboard keys based on frequency of first letter
