Below are the main visualizations generated from my Coding out Loud project, along with descriptions of what they're visualizing. 

This visualization is a histogram of the most common first letters in the online game Wordle. This visualization is a preface for the further visualizations which show this on a keyboard format

This is the first visualization generated from Wordle dataset manipulation. This visualizes the most common first letters in the online game Wordle in a keyboard format. This is more intuitive for data in a letter format as it isn't easy to visually differentiate between 26 bars on a histogram. For the colors, I switched those originally provided in the video and used an ascending color palette as it makes it easier to visually differentiate between the more frequent (darker orange) letters and the less frequent (lighter orange) levels organized by quintile. Lastly, I also changed the theme of the keyboard initially provided in the video.

To extend the original project, I recreated the visualization from above but with the most common second letter in a Wordle word. All other specifics about the visualization are the same

Finally, this visualization are the same as the two above, except this one visualizes the most common third letter in a Wordle word.
